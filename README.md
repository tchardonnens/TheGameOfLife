## Context

The Game of Life is a popular computer program and mathematical model created by John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a cellular automaton, which means that it is a set of cells arranged in a grid, where each cell can be in one of a finite number of states.

The game is played on a two-dimensional grid, where each cell is either "alive" or "dead". The rules of the game specify how cells evolve over time. At each step, the state of each cell is updated based on the states of its eight neighbors. The rules are as follows:

A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (birth).
A live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies of loneliness (underpopulation).
A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies of overcrowding (overpopulation).
The game of life has no players or strategies, it is just a simulation that runs on its own. The patterns that emerge from the game can be very complex and interesting, and have been studied in various fields such as biology, physics, and computer science.
